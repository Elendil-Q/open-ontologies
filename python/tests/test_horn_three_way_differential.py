"""The three-way differential in the suite, and PROVED ABLE TO FAIL.

`tools/horn_differential.py` runs the Rust engine, this Python engine and the Lean
checker over every RDF document the repository tracks and requires the two engines to
derive the same set of triples while the checker accepts both certificates. This file
keeps a bounded slice of that run inside the test suite, so the tool cannot rot
unnoticed between full runs, and it does the thing a differential is worthless without:
it breaks one engine on purpose and shows each gate firing.

HOW INDEPENDENT THE TWO ENGINES ARE, WHICH IS LESS THAN THE WORD SUGGESTS. They are not
independent implementations. Both run the same semi-naive forward-chaining algorithm
over the same rule table, and this engine's comments cite `src/reason.rs` by file and
line. Agreement is therefore STRONG evidence against a transcription slip in one of the
two and CLOSE TO NO evidence against a shared misreading of a W3C rule, which both would
implement and agree on for ever. The independent leg is the Lean checker. Nothing in
this file may be quoted as "two independent reasoners agree"; the tool prints that
sentence next to its agreement count on every run.

WHY THE GATE TESTS MATTER MORE THAN THE AGREEMENT TESTS. A comparison that cannot fail
is worse than no comparison, because it reports agreement for ever. Three deliberate
defects are injected below, each of which a careless differential would pass:

  * a derivation silently dropped, leaving a certificate the Lean checker STILL ACCEPTS,
    because every step that remains is sound. Only the set comparison sees the loss.
  * a conclusion forged, which the Lean checker rejects. The tool must call that
    CHECKER_REJECTED and not DISAGREE: one broken emitter is not two engines disagreeing.
  * an asserted graph the other engine never saw, which has to be caught BEFORE the
    conclusions are compared, because a derived-set comparison over two different graphs
    means nothing.

WHAT THE SLICE IS AND IS NOT. The cases below were chosen for RULE COVERAGE and not for
size, from the per-rule histogram of a full run on 14 September 2026. Between them they
fire every one of the 20 rules the whole corpus fires, over 17,001 asserted triples and
6,828 derived ones, and they exercise the refusal path (a rule head that instantiates to
a triple no serialiser can write) on 204 conclusions. They are a canary. THE EVIDENCE IS
THE FULL RUN, which this file does not reproduce because it takes twelve minutes:

    python3 tools/horn_differential.py --bundles --json out.json

Measured there on 15 September 2026: 291 single documents carrying 203,825 asserted
triples and deriving 19,624, plus 24 bundles of those same documents deriving 59,115
(the two derived counts overlap and must not be added, because a bundle re-derives most
of what its members derive alone), plus the 7 coverage fixtures, which are test data and
are counted apart from all of it. Identical sets on both engines in every one of the 322
cases, every certificate accepted, no disagreement. Fifteen cases did not run and each is
listed with its reason: four bundles over the 8.4 MB cap, nine documents that do not
parse or parse to nothing, and the two OAEI anatomy OWL files, which time out at 900s.
Set HORN_DIFF_FULL=1 to run every tracked document here too.

THE SEVEN RULES THE CORPUS CANNOT EXERCISE. `prp-inv2`, `eq-sym`, `cls-avf`, `cls-hv1`,
`cls-hv2`, `scm-svf2` and `scm-avf2` fire in no document this repository tracks, so the
corpus run compared the two engines on them zero times and said nothing whatever about
them. `tests/fixtures/horn-coverage/` now holds one deliberately constructed graph per
silent rule, each the smallest thing that makes exactly that rule fire, and
`test_the_seven_rules_the_corpus_cannot_reach_are_covered_by_fixtures` runs all seven
here. The two coverage figures are reported apart and must never be added: 20 of 27 on
the repository's own RDF, 27 of 27 once graphs written for the purpose are included. A
rule covered only by its own fixture has been compared on one graph made to fire it and
on no real ontology, which is a great deal better than zero and is not the same claim.
