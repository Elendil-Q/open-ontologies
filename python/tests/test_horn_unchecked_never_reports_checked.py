"""A result the Lean checker never saw must carry no verdict, in its own words.

This is the C2/C3 gate and the one CI actually runs, because CI installs `[dev]`
and nothing else: no elan, no `lake`, no `oo-horn`. Every green tick on this
repository's Python job is therefore a statement about the UNCHECKED path, and
this file is what makes that statement worth anything.

The failure being guarded against is not a crash. It is a report that looks
successful: a derivation count, a certificate directory, and a verdict word
sitting beside them that no checker ever pronounced. That is assurance
laundering with the engine's own output as the source, and the only defence that
survives refactoring is a test asserting that the verdict word does not appear
ANYWHERE in the report when nothing was checked, not merely that some `checked`
flag is False.

The first test simulates the real shape of the absence: a package with no
repository above it, which is what `pip install open-ontologies-lite` gives, and
an empty PATH. It copies the installed package to a temporary directory for
exactly that reason, since the repo probe in `find_checker` would otherwise find
the `lake build` output sitting two levels above this checkout and the test would
prove nothing about a wheel.
