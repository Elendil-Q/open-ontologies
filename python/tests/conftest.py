"""`OO_REQUIRE_FIXTURES=1` turns a skip into a failure here too.

The Rust suite has had this since `tests/common/mod.rs` was written: a test that
skips for want of a toolchain prints a `SKIPPED_FIXTURE:` marker, and any job
that is supposed to PROVIDE that toolchain sets `OO_REQUIRE_FIXTURES=1`, which
makes the skip fatal. The `lean` job runs fifteen legs that way, and
`w3c-shacl` one more. The Python suite had no equivalent of any kind: no
`conftest.py` existed, no test read the variable, and every `pytest.skip` and
`pytest.importorskip` in `python/tests/` was unconditional and unpromotable.

That mattered most where it hurt most. `test_horn_three_way_differential.py` is
the three-way differential — the Rust engine, this Python engine and the Lean
checker over the same documents — and the CI `python` job installed the `dev`
extra and nothing else: no `cargo build`, so no Rust engine; no elan, so no
`oo-horn`. The file's own preflight found neither and skipped every test in it.
A green tick on that job said nothing whatsoever about the differential, which
is the precise shape of failure this repository exists to attack: a gate that
passes by not running. Setting `OO_REQUIRE_FIXTURES=1` on the job would not have
helped, because nothing on this side read it.

The rule is deliberately GLOBAL rather than per-call-site. In Rust a skip has to
be written through `common::skip_unless` to be catchable, so a new one added by
hand is invisible to the convention; here every skip is caught, whatever raised
it — `pytest.skip`, a `skipif` marker, a module-level `pytest.importorskip` —
and a new one cannot be added without either providing the dependency or
declaring the skip deliberate.

DELIBERATE SKIPS. A test skipped because it is SLOW rather than because
something is missing is a different thing, and marking it `@pytest.mark.oo_opt_in`
exempts it. There is exactly one: the full-corpus differential, which takes
twelve minutes. The marker is greppable, which a reason string is not.
