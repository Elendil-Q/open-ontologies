"""The bridge to the verified checker, and the vocabulary of what a run earned.

This module states no verdict of its own. On acceptance it copies the checker's
words out of its stdout verbatim; on anything else it says, in its own words,
that nothing was checked. The two verdicts the checker can print are

* the absolute one, for a certificate over the BUILT-IN table, which
  `OOCert.Builtin.asHorn_sound` discharges against the semantics: every
  conclusion is true in every model of the asserted graph;
* the relativised one, `entailed_under_supplied_rules`, for a certificate over
  ANY other table, including the built-ins plus one extra rule: every conclusion
  is true in every model of the asserted graph THAT ALSO SATISFIES those rules.
  The rules are assumed and never checked, so a rule reading "every supplier is
  compliant" produces certificates that check green for ever.

Which of the two a run earned is decided inside `lean/HMain.lean`, by a full
ordered equality between the table it was handed and the built-in one. Deciding
it a second time here would make Python a second place where the two can be
confused, which is exactly the hazard decision 0003 exists to prevent, so this
module does not compare the tables, does not default the verdict, and does not
contain either verdict word as an executable string. `verdict` is only ever
assigned from the payload, and the rejection JSON has no `verdict` key at all,
so `payload.get("verdict", ...)` is not a hypothetical mistake: it is the
natural way to write that line and it is the exact shape of the laundering
failure.

The checker is an OPTIONAL EXTERNAL BINARY. It is built by `lake` from `lean/`,
it is deliberately not a Python dependency of any kind, not even an extra, and
this package is fully functional without it. What it must never do is report an
unchecked result as checked, so every outcome below carries `checked` and a
`status` word, and four of the six say plainly that nothing was proved.
