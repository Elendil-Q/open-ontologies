# Witnesses: the specification says something, and it does not say everything

`eval_conforms_iff` and `validate_spec` are worth nothing on their own. If `Conf`
held of every focus node, "the evaluator reports nothing exactly when the node
conforms" would be a promise that the evaluator never reports anything, and the
theorem would still be true. If `Conf` held of none, the mirror image. This file
closes both by construction, the way `lean/OOCert/Witness.lean` does for the
derivation checker.

| theorem | says |
|---|---|
| `alice_conforms` | some node conforms to a real shape, proved from the specification by hand |
| `bob_does_not_conform` | some node does not, so `Conf` is not the trivial relation |
| `the_report_is_empty_when_everything_conforms` | `validate` can return nothing |
| `the_report_names_the_failing_node` | and it can return something, naming the right node and component |
| `duplicate_triples_are_counted_once` | `sh:maxCount` counts the SET of value nodes |
| `two_distinct_values_break_maxCount_one` | and it really does count them |
| `the_evaluator_refuses_rather_than_guessing` | the third answer is reachable, not decoration |
| `four_point_zero_is_at_most_four` | the value-range constraints compare VALUES, not spellings |
| `four_point_one_is_not_at_most_four` | and they still reject something |
| `a_string_is_not_greater_than_a_number` | a SPARQL type error is a violation, not a refusal |
| `mixed_timezones_are_unordered` | a dateTime with a timezone and one without can be UNORDERED |
| `a_day_earlier_is_ordered_even_across_the_window` | and that is not a blanket refusal |
| `a_blank_node_has_no_length` | a blank node fails every length constraint |
| `an_iri_is_as_long_as_it_is_written` | and an IRI does not |
| `a_sequence_path_reaches_two_steps` | a sequence path is a join, not a union |
| `a_sequence_path_does_not_stop_halfway` | and the intermediate node is not a value node |
| `zero_or_one_admits_the_focus_node` | `sh:zeroOrOnePath` gives a bare focus node one value node |

## These have been seen to fail

Changing `strRep` so that a blank node reports `chars []` rather than `noString`,
which is the natural mistake (a blank node has no string, so treat it as the empty
one), leaves the whole development compiling and the agreement theorem true, because
the specification and the evaluator both read `strRep`. This file is what stops it:

```text
error: Shacl/Witness.lean:284:62: Tactic `decide` proved that the proposition
  ¬Conf [] (Shape.minLength 0) "_:b"
is false
```

A witness pins a reading of the Recommendation that no proof about internal
agreement can pin. That is why they are here and why each one comes in a pair.

The two counting theorems are the ones worth reading. SHACL counts distinct value
nodes, so a triple asserted twice must not make a `sh:maxCount 1` fail. An engine
that counts SPARQL solutions rather than value nodes gets that wrong, and the
repository's own SHACL validator is documented as counting the other way
(`docs/lean-certificates.md`, "A SHACL report double-counts a node selected by two
target declarations"). Here it is settled in the specification and proved.

/-! ## The third answer is reachable

A refusal that never fires is decoration. This one fires on the first
`rdf:XMLLiteral` it meets: RDF 1.1 says that datatype's lexical space is the set of
strings that are well-balanced, self-contained XML content, and deciding that needs
an XML parser this development does not have and will not pretend to have.
`tests/shacl_core_verified_test.rs` counts how often a refusal happens across the
W3C suite. -/

def litXml : Term :=
  "\"<b>hi</b>\"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral>"

/-- The literal has the right datatype IRI, so the constraint turns on whether it is
well formed, and `lexOK` does not know. The evaluator says so by name instead of
choosing an answer. -/
theorem the_evaluator_refuses_rather_than_guessing :
    eval [] (.datatype xmlLiteral) exShape litXml
      = .error (.unknownLexicalSpace xmlLiteral "<b>hi</b>") := by rfl

/-- The specification, meanwhile, treats an unjudgeable literal as non-conforming.
So the two possible behaviours at this point were "report a violation" and "report a
refusal", and the evaluator takes the weaker one. Neither is a false pass, which is
the property that matters. -/

/-! ## The parameters added after the first eleven components

Each one below exhibits a model and something the semantics does NOT entail, the
same discipline the two counting theorems follow. A one-sided witness would leave
open that the new clause is trivially true or trivially false. Every one is settled
by kernel computation, so a change to the decision procedure breaks it rather than
passing quietly. -/

def lit41dec : Term := "\"4.1\"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal>"

/-- **Comparison is by value, not by spelling.** `"4"^^xsd:integer` and
`"4.0"^^xsd:decimal` are two different TERMS, and `sh:maxInclusive 4` admits the
second. A validator comparing spellings would report a violation here. -/

  CmpIs.not_of_eq (k := .lt) (by decide) (by decide)

/-- **A pair SPARQL cannot compare is a violation, not a refusal.** `sh:minExclusive`
is defined as a SPARQL expression that must return TRUE, and `4 < "Hello"` is a type
error, which is not true. -/

/-! ## Axioms, pinned

Every pin below is the footprint `#print axioms` actually reports, not the one the
rest of this repository standardises on. Two of these theorems come out at
`[propext]` alone, a strict subset: they are settled by kernel computation and never
reach `Classical.choice`. Pinning what is true rather than what is expected is the
point of the exercise, and a proof that grew a dependency would break the pin. -/
