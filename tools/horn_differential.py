"""Three-way differential: the Rust engine, the Python engine and the Lean checker,
over one Horn rule table and every ontology this repository ships.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `src/reason.rs` and `python/src/open_ontologies_lite/horn/` are two
independent implementations of the same specification, and `lean/` holds a checker
whose soundness is a machine-checked theorem. Running all three over one corpus finds
defects none of them finds alone. Agreement on a handful of hand-made files is weak
evidence, so the corpus is every RDF document tracked in the repository, and the report
says how many ontologies and how many derived triples the claim rests on.

THIS TOOL DOES NOT ADJUDICATE. It is modelled on `tools/shacl_differential.py` and on
`tools/fol_differential.py`, whose first paragraph is "THE ATP IS AN ORACLE, NOT AN
AUTHORITY". A disagreement is a defect in ONE OF THE THREE and the job is to name it,
print the ontology and the triple, and stop the line. Nothing here edits either engine
to make a difference disappear, and no verdict word is decided in this file: both are
read out of the checker's JSON.

WHAT IS COMPARED.

  1. THE SAME GRAPH REACHES BOTH ENGINES, and this is the part that is easy to get
     wrong. Two parses of one Turtle document label blank nodes differently (measured:
     1267 of pizza.ttl's 1848 triples carry one, and not a single label survives), so a
     naive run compares two graphs that are isomorphic but not equal and reports a
     thousand phantom disagreements. The fix is a canonical intermediate: Python parses
     the source once, dumps the default graph to N-Triples, and BOTH engines read that
     file. Oxigraph preserves explicit `_:` labels from N-Triples, so the asserted sets
     then agree line for line, which every run asserts before comparing anything else.
     A difference there is INPUT_DIFFERS and blocks, because a derived-set comparison
     over two different graphs means nothing.

  2. SET EQUALITY OF DERIVED TRIPLES, blank nodes included, no shape fudging. Byte
     identity of the two `horn.tsv` files is NOT a goal and must not be asserted: the
     Rust emitter sorts interned `u32` triples (`src/reason.rs`, `all.sort_unstable()`),
     so its line order is first-appearance order in the store, not lexicographic.

  3. BOTH CERTIFICATES STAND ON THEIR OWN. Each goes to `oo-horn check` before their
     contents are compared. Two certificates that disagree, one of which the checker
     rejects, is not a differential result: it is one broken emitter.

  4. COVERAGE BY RULE. A rule that never fires anywhere in the corpus is a rule this run
     says nothing about. The per-rule histogram is printed for exactly that reason, and
     a reader who skips it will overstate what agreement was shown.

BUNDLES, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT OPTIONAL. Run one file at a time and most of the OWL
rules never fire, because the repository ships a TBox in one directory and the ABox
that instantiates it in another: `rdfs9` needs a type assertion and a subclass axiom in
the same graph, `rdfs2` needs a property with a domain and somebody using it. A
per-file run over 297 documents exercised 15 of 27 rules. `--bundles` unions the
documents of a directory, of an area, and of the two directories the repository pairs by
convention, so the ABox meets the TBox. Every bundle is named in the report with the
number of files in it.

The target is `run_horn` and not `run_full`. `run_full` is the hardcoded-arm engine and
carries guards the table does not (`rdfs11` is guarded `a != b && b != c && a != c`,
`rdfs3` on a non-literal object), so a comparison against it is characterisation, not an
assertion.

Verdicts, in order of severity:

  DISAGREE          the two engines were handed the same asserted graph and derived
                    different sets. The stop-the-line case. The ontology and the triples
                    are printed, never summarised away.
  CHECKER_REJECTED  `oo-horn` rejected a certificate. Worse than a disagreement: a
                    machine-checked theorem says a rejected step does not follow.
  VERDICT_DIFFERS   both accepted, and the checker pronounced differently on them, or a
                    rule-table digest does not match. The two runs were not over the
                    same table.
  INPUT_DIFFERS     the two asserted graphs are not equal, so nothing downstream is
                    comparable.
  INCOMPLETE        an engine stopped on an iteration cap. Its count is a lower bound
                    and not the closure, so equality would be meaningless.
  PARSE_DIFFERS     informational, and not a reasoning result: loading the ORIGINAL
                    source directly in Rust yields a different triple count from
                    Python's parse of it. The reasoning comparison is unaffected,
                    because both engines read the canonical N-Triples.
  REFUSAL_DIFFERS   informational: equal derived sets, different counts of conclusions
                    refused as unwritable.
  ATTRIBUTION_DIFFERS  informational: equal derived sets, different per-rule credit. A
                    triple two rules can derive is credited to whichever fired first, so
                    this is an ordering artefact and not a defect.
  NOT_RUN           skipped, with the reason. Never silent.
  AGREE             identical derived sets, both certificates accepted, same verdict.

Usage:
    python3 tools/horn_differential.py [--bundles] [--json out.json] [--limit N]
                                       [--jobs N] [--timeout S] [--max-bytes N]
                                       [--include SUBSTRING] [--exclude SUBSTRING]
                                       [--root DIR] [--verbose]

Requires the Rust binary and the Lean checker. If either is missing the run SKIPS
LOUDLY and exits 0, the way the Lean-dependent tests skip on a missing `lake`; set
HORN_DIFF_REQUIRE_TOOLS=1 to turn that skip into a failure, as OO_REQUIRE_FIXTURES=1
does in the Rust suite.
