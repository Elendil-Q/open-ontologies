//! The generic Horn-rule certificate layer.
//!
//! The checker in `lean/OOCert/Rules.lean` has one arm per built-in rule, which
//! does not scale to rules a user writes, and rules a user writes are the whole
//! logic-programming family: RIF Core, Datalog, SWRL. `lean/OOCert/Horn.lean`
//! replaces the per-rule arms with a single generic one. A certificate cites a
//! rule by index into a supplied table, gives a binding, and the checker
//! verifies that the binding instantiates the rule's body into known triples
//! and its head into the claimed conclusion. `OOCert.horn_certificate_sound` is
//! proved once, for every rule table at once.
//!
//! # The distinction these tests exist to protect
//!
//! Two runs of the same checker prove different things.
//!
//! Over the BUILT-IN table, `Builtin.asHorn_sound` discharges every rule against
//! the semantics, so the result is absolute entailment: true in every model of
//! the asserted graph. `OOCert.entails_of_builtin_horn`.
//!
//! Over a table the user supplied, nothing discharges the rules. They are
//! assumptions the certificate carries, so the result is relative: true in every
//! model of the graph that ALSO satisfies those rules.
//! `OOCert.horn_certificate_sound`. A rule reading "every supplier is compliant"
//! makes certificates that check green for ever, and the certificate certifies
//! the inference, never the premises.
//!
//! Collapsing those into one verdict turns a verified checker into a device for
//! laundering an assumption into a fact. `a_user_rule_never_earns_the_absolute_verdict`
//! is the test that fails if that ever happens.
