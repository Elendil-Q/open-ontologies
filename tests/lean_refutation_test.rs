//! `oo-refute/1`: certifying that a graph has NO model.
//!
//! Seventeen rules in the OWL 2 RL profile conclude `false` rather than a
//! triple; `lean/OOCert/Refute.lean` lists all seventeen with the W3C tables
//! they come from. The derivation certificate cannot express that, because
//! `Step.conclusion` is a `Triple` and `OOCert.certificate_sound` concludes
//! `Entails`. There is no triple to conclude. `Refute.lean` adds the second
//! format, with `cax-dw` as its one rule, and `OOCert.refutation_sound` proved
//! about it. Of the sixteen it does not implement, fifteen are expressible in
//! that layer and absent; `dt-not-type` is not expressible there at all,
//! because `OOCert.Semantics` has no datatype value space, which is the same
//! ground on which `the_rules_that_were_left_out_stay_out` in
//! `reason_rl_coverage_test.rs` keeps the whole `dt-*` family out of the
//! engine.
//!
//! # The two things this file exists to protect
//!
//! **A refutation must be able to fail.** Six forgeries are checked, one per
//! way to lie: an invented disjointness axiom, a premise whose predicate is not
//! `owl:disjointWith`, two class memberships about different individuals, a
//! forged derivation prefix, a missing prefix so that a premise was never
//! derived, and the right three premises in the wrong order. A seventh case is
//! a graph that is genuinely consistent, where the refutation must be rejected
//! because there is nothing to find. `OOCert.feed_is_not_refuted` proves that
//! rejection is correct rather than a limitation.
//!
//! **The verdict must not outrun what was proved.** `Unsat G` means no
//! interpretation satisfies `Model I G` AND `RefuteConditions I`. It is
//! unsatisfiability relative to reading `owl:disjointWith` as disjointness, not
//! absolute unsatisfiability, and the report says so.
//!
//! # The trap, which is why `guard` exists
//!
//! Over a refuted graph every triple is entailed under the disjointness-aware
//! reading, so a derivation certificate carries no information. But `oo-cert`
//! still reports `"ok":true` for it, and what it reports is TRUE: its verdict
//! quantifies over `OOCert.Model I G` alone, a class that is never empty
//! because `Conditions` has no negative condition and cannot notice a clash.
//! `the_old_checker_still_says_yes_to_the_refuted_graph` runs both binaries on
//! the same two files and pins the contradiction between their verdicts, so the
//! contrast is computed here rather than asserted in a docstring.
