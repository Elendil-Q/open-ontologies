//! Soundness regressions for the OWL-DL tableaux reasoner.
//!
//! These tests use ontologies whose satisfiability is a mathematical certainty,
//! so they need no reference reasoner to establish ground truth:
//!
//!   An ontology containing no negation, no disjointness, no owl:Nothing and no
//!   max-cardinality restriction is ALWAYS satisfiable, and every class in it is
//!   satisfiable. Witness model: a single element x, every role interpreted as
//!   {(x,x)}, and x a member of every class. Every GCI C ⊑ D holds because x is
//!   in both; every ∃R.C holds because R(x,x) and x ∈ C.
//!
//! So if the reasoner reports "unsatisfiable" for any class in such an ontology,
//! it is wrong, full stop.
