//! Model certificates for the SHIQ tableaux reasoner, end to end.
//!
//! `src/tableaux.rs` answers satisfiability, classification and ABox
//! consistency, and until now every answer was a bare verdict. The positive
//! answers now carry a finite model, and `lean/Dl/` holds a checker for it whose
//! soundness is a machine-checked theorem: `Dl.satisfiable_of_checkModel` says
//! that an interpretation the checker accepts is a model, so the axiom set it
//! was checked against really is satisfiable. These tests close that loop.
//!
//!   1. The reasoner emits and the checker accepts. A class the reasoner says is
//!      satisfiable comes with a model of the TBox in which that class is not
//!      empty, and an ABox the reasoner says is consistent comes with a model of
//!      the TBox and the ABox together.
//!   2. The checker can say no, and each way it can say no is exercised on its
//!      own. A model with a required successor removed, a model that violates a
//!      disjointness, a model whose domain omits a named individual, and a model
//!      that satisfies every TBox axiom while leaving empty the very class the
//!      reasoner called satisfiable. Four separate forgeries, four separate
//!      runs, four separate rejections. A gate that cannot fail is decoration.
//!   3. The negative answers carry NOTHING, and the emitter says so rather than
//!      inventing a certificate. An unsatisfiable class produces `Refuted` and
//!      writes no file.
//!   4. The emitter refuses instead of emitting something that will not check.
//!      One case where it refuses is not a limitation of the certificate layer
//!      but a defect in the reasoner, and that case is pinned here.
//!
//! The checker needs a Lean toolchain (`lake`) AND the `oo-dlmodel` target in
//! `lean/lakefile.toml`. Without either these tests skip loudly through
//! `common::skip_unless`; the CI job that installs Lean runs them with
//! `OO_REQUIRE_FIXTURES=1`, which turns that skip into a failure.

// ── 6. A real ontology, class by class ──────────────────────────────────

/// The hand-written fixtures above prove the machinery works. This proves it
/// works on something nobody wrote for it.
///
/// Every named class of a shipped ontology is put through the reasoner, and
/// every class it reports satisfiable has its model checked by `oo-dlmodel`. The
/// interesting number is the disagreements, which must be zero: the emitter's
/// own gate and the verified checker have to agree on every single one, or one
/// of the two is wrong.
