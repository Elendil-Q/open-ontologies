//! Each phase of a reasoning run gets its own budget.
//!
//! `DlReasoner` fixed ONE wall-clock deadline when it was constructed and shared
//! it across the satisfiability sweep, the subsumption sweep and the ABox check.
//! A classification that used the clock up left the ABox check starting already
//! expired, so it reported `undecided` on an ontology it decides in under a
//! millisecond. That is honest rather than false, which is why it survived, but
//! it means a loaded machine silently degrades an answer that was available.
//!
//! This file lives on its own because it moves a PROCESS-WIDE budget setting.
//! `cargo test` runs each test binary as its own process but runs the tests
//! inside one binary on a shared thread pool, so a file that shrinks the global
//! timeout must not contain anything else that a shrunken timeout would break.
//! Hence one test, and it restores the setting on the way out.

/// and then lets more than that budget elapse before asking the ABox question —
/// which is what a real classification sweep does to the ABox check when it runs
/// long. A deadline minted at construction is already gone by then and the
/// answer comes back `undecided`. A budget minted when the phase STARTS is not,
/// and the answer comes back decided.
