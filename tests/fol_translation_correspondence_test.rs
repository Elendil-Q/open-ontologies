//! The emitted first-order logic IS the translation `OwlLean/Translation.lean`
//! defines, for a set of worked cases.
//!
//! This is the point of the first-order export. It is not enough that the file
//! parses, and it is not enough that a prover likes it: `owl-lean` carries a
//! machine-checked adequacy theorem, `OwlLean.adequacy`, and that theorem is
//! worth citing only if the Rust emitter emits the translation the theorem is
//! about. Every expected string below was computed BY HAND from
//! `OwlLean/Translation.lean`, unrolling `tr`, `trAx`, `mkEx`, `mkAll`,
//! `distinctPairs`, `somePairEq`, `Form.conj` and `Form.disj`, and the counter
//! arithmetic with them.
//!
//! **The correspondence is pinned by these tests and is NOT itself proved.**
//! Nothing mechanically checks that `Translation::axiom` is `OwlLean.trAx`.
//! This file is the only thing that will notice if the Rust and the Lean drift
//! apart, which is exactly why the cases are hand-computed rather than
//! recorded from a run: a golden file captured from the emitter would agree
//! with the emitter by construction and would have caught nothing.
//!
//! The tests are grouped:
//!
//!   1. `tr` and `trAx`, case by case, pinned against hand-computed TPTP.
//!   2. The two things the adequacy theorem needs: the freshness side
//!      condition and the individual typing axioms, each with the countermodel
//!      from `OwlLean/Refutations.lean` reconstructed as a test.
//!   3. One translation, two serialisers: the CLIF output is read back with a
//!      small S-expression reader defined here and must recover the identical
//!      `Form`, so a drift in either writer is caught.
//!   4. The CLIF output stays inside the first-order-equivalent fragment of
//!      Common Logic.
//!   5. Constructs outside the fragment are named in the output.
