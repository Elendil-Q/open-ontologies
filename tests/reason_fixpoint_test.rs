//! The reasoner must reach a fixpoint of its own rule set in one run.
//!
//! Found by an adversarial audit, 13 Sep 2026. Only the three data indices
//! (`rdf:type`, `rdfs:subClassOf`, `rdfs:subPropertyOf`) were rebuilt each
//! iteration. Every schema index (`rdfs:domain`, `rdfs:range`, the property
//! characteristics, `owl:inverseOf`, the equivalences, the restriction maps and
//! the RDF lists behind `owl:intersectionOf` / `owl:unionOf`) was filtered once
//! out of the pre-loop snapshot. A schema triple the reasoner itself derived
//! was therefore never used as a premise, and running `reason` twice derived
//! more than running it once.
//!
//! For query answers that is incompleteness. For certificates it is worse:
//! materialising turns run N's conclusions into run N+1's premises, so
//! `asserted.tsv` can list the reasoner's own output as an axiom with nothing
//! marking it as derived, and `certificate_sound` is conditional on the
//! assertions. One run reaching the fixpoint is what makes one certificate the
//! whole story.
