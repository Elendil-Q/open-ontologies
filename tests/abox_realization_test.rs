//! Realizing individuals into classes DEFINED by owl:equivalentClass.
//!
//! `check_abox` reads concept labels off one completed tableau. That is sound for detecting
//! inconsistency but it is not realization: a concept satisfied in whichever model the
//! expansion happened to find is not thereby entailed, and the branch that would add a
//! defined class is usually not the branch recorded. The observable effect was that defining
//! a class by owl:equivalentClass and letting the reasoner find its members did not work at
//! all, for any ontology. Three separate causes had to be fixed:
//!
//!   1. individual nodes carried no atom for themselves, so the nominal approximation behind
//!      owl:hasValue could never be satisfied;
//!   2. the class subsumption closure was built from the ROLE hierarchy, so a definition
//!      naming a superclass never matched an individual typed by a subclass;
//!   3. datatype-property assertions were discarded entirely, so a definition selecting
//!      individuals by a boolean flag matched nothing.
//!
//! Found by running this engine against an ontology of our own whose defect classes are all
//! defined by equivalence, and cross-checked against an OWL RL reasoner, which derives the
//! same members.

// ── Individuals the realizer never looked at ────────────────────────────────
//
// `realize_definitions` iterated `individual_types`, which is keyed by
// individuals carrying at least one NAMED `rdf:type`. Two kinds of individual
// have no entry there and were therefore never realized into any defined class,
// however completely they met the definition:
//
//   1. an individual with no `rdf:type` at all, named only by its own role
//      assertions — `build_abox_tableau` already gives these a node, precisely
//      because `rdfs:domain` binds them and a disjointness axiom can refute
//      them, so the consistency check saw them and the realizer did not;
//   2. an individual typed ONLY by an anonymous class expression, which lands in
//      `individual_anon_types` and never in `individual_types`.
//
// This is a false NEGATIVE, not a false clean, which is why it survived. It is
// still an incompleteness with nothing behind it: `satisfies` declines anything
// outside its fragment, so handing it an empty named-type set can only fail to
// match, never match wrongly.
