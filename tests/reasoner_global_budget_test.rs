//! `classify_timeout_ms` bounds a real run, or the run says that it does not.
//!
//! The setting defaults to 180 000 ms and its own documentation calls it "the
//! budget that actually bounds the run". It has never bounded one. Two separate
//! reasons, and both are here:
//!
//!   1. **It could not fire.** Each phase of a classification opens its own
//!      deadline from `tableaux_test_timeout_ms`, which defaults to 10 000 ms.
//!      Four phases had one — consistency, satisfiability, subsumption, ABox —
//!      for a worst case of 40 000 ms, so a 180 000 ms global deadline was dead
//!      arithmetic. Explanation is the fifth and had no clock at all, which is
//!      point 2 below; with it under the same budget the worst case is 50 000 ms
//!      and the ceiling is still dead arithmetic, which is what the run now says
//!      in words. An earlier attempt to fix this by minting a deadline per
//!      TABLEAU did hand the global budget the run, and took a 20-ontology
//!      corpus from 67s to over 600s. It was abandoned, correctly, and the knob
//!      stayed. (That 67s is unreproducible — its corpus was never written down.
//!      `tests/reasoner_budget_corpus_bench.rs` pins two that were.)
//!   2. **It did not cover the run.** `classify_timeout_ms` was read inside
//!      `classify_parallel` and nowhere else, so the TBox consistency check
//!      before it, the ABox check after it and the explanation loop after that
//!      each opened a fresh budget of their own. A run could therefore exceed
//!      `classify_timeout_ms` outright, which is the opposite of a ceiling. The
//!      explanation loop had no wall-clock budget at all: `Tableau::
//!      new_with_tracing` left `Budget::deadline` at `None`.
//!
//! What a knob that reads as a safety limit may not do is enforce nothing. It
//! now enforces a ceiling over every phase, at no cost, because a phase deadline
//! is intersected with the global one rather than minted beside it — and where
//! the arithmetic means the ceiling cannot be what stops the run, the output
//! SAYS which bound is in force instead of leaving a reader to infer it from two
//! settings and a phase count.
//!
//! This file lives on its own and holds ONE test, for the reason
//! `reasoner_phase_budget_test.rs` gives: it moves process-wide budget settings,
//! and `cargo test` runs the tests inside one binary on a shared thread pool.
