//! One certificate carrying both rule families.
//!
//! Until `lean/OOCert/Mixed.lean` landed, a certificate was either all built-in
//! arms (`OOCert.certificate_sound`) or all citations of a user-supplied Horn
//! rule (`OOCert.horn_certificate_sound`). That split is not cosmetic.
//! `cls-int1` and `cls-uni` read an RDF list off the graph, so their premise
//! count is the length of that list rather than something the rule fixes, and
//! they are never going to become Horn rules. A user with one rule of their own
//! therefore could not cite them at all.
//!
//! `OOCert.checkCertM` accepts both step kinds and `OOCert.mixed_certificate_sound`
//! covers both in one induction. The certificate exercised below is the smallest
//! one that needs the feature: a `cls-int1` step concludes that acme is a
//! `Supplier`, and a step citing a rule the checker has never heard of turns that
//! into a compliance claim.
//!
//! # The distinction these tests exist to protect
//!
//! A mixed certificate over a table the user supplied proves the RELATIVE
//! guarantee: every conclusion is true in every model of the asserted graph that
//! ALSO satisfies those rules. Nothing checks the rules. The rule used here is
//! decision 0003's own example, "every supplier is compliant", and
//! `OOCert.mix_not_absolutely_entailed` is a machine-checked proof that its
//! conclusion does NOT follow from the asserted graph alone: there is a model of
//! that graph in which acme has no status at all.
//!
//! So a run over this table must print `entailed_under_supplied_rules` and must
//! never print `entailed`. `a_user_rule_never_earns_the_absolute_verdict` is the
//! test that fails if it ever does, and `OOCert.absolute_verdict_is_earned` is
//! the theorem that says the report function cannot do it in the first place.
//!
//! # How these tests run Lean
//!
//! There is no `oo-mixed` binary. Adding one means editing `lean/lakefile.toml`,
//! which this change does not own, so each case is a small generated Lean file
//! run through `lake env lean --run`. It imports the same library `lake build`
//! proved and calls the same `checkCertM`. What it does NOT exercise is a file
//! format: there is no parser for a mixed certificate yet, and the certificates
//! below are Lean terms rather than TSV. That is a real gap, stated here rather
//! than left to be discovered.
