//! What a change to the reasoner's budgets costs, measured rather than asserted.
//!
//! `src/tableaux.rs` carries a cost measurement in a doc comment — "a
//! 20-ontology corpus went from 67s to over 600s" — over a corpus that is
//! written down NOWHERE, so it cannot be re-run and this file does not reproduce
//! it. It measures two corpora that ARE in the tree instead, neither of which is
//! that one: the twenty case studies reach no budget at all, and the ten hard
//! ones have two reaching one rather than five. A number in a comment that
//! nobody can re-run is a number that goes stale silently, and the budget it
//! justifies is exactly the kind of setting that gets changed by someone who
//! cannot check what it costs.
//!
//! TWO corpora, both fixed and both in the repository. `CORPUS` is every `*.ttl`
//! under a `case-studies/**/ontology/` directory, plus the two core ontologies
//! that live one level up, minus `occupational-map.ttl`, which is 5.7 MB and is
//! already excluded from the certificate corpus for the same reason: twenty
//! files, none of which reaches a budget. `HARD` is ten from `benchmark/` that
//! cost something, two of which exhaust one. Both are needed, and the reason is
//! in the comment on `HARD`.
//!
//! IGNORED by default, because it takes minutes and measures wall clock, which
//! is not a thing an assertion should be built on. Run it deliberately:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test reasoner_budget_corpus_bench -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! The numbers below are from THAT command, the debug profile, because that is
//! what `cargo test` runs and comparing a debug total against a release total
//! measures the optimiser. Add `--release` if you want to, and then compare only
//! release against release.
//!
//! It prints per-ontology wall time, the phases that ran out of budget, and the
//! total. Compare two totals; do not compare a total against a number in a
//! comment written on a different machine.
//!
//! MEASURED, 15 September 2026, `cargo test` debug profile, this machine,
//! alternating the two builds so they share whatever load the machine was under
//! — which matters more than it sounds: an earlier pair of runs differed by a
//! factor of four purely because a release build was competing with one of them.
//! The change under test is `phase_deadline_within`, which puts every phase
//! under the `classify_timeout_ms` ceiling, plus the widening of definition
//! realization to untyped individuals.
//!
//! THREE RUNS OF EACH BUILD, not one, because one run of each cannot tell a cost
//! from the machine:
//!
//! | corpus | before | after |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | twenty case-study ontologies, none reaching a budget | 0.33 / 0.09 / 0.09s | 0.10 / 0.34 / 0.08s |
//! | ten that do, two of them exhausting one | 62.42 / 62.78 / 65.10s | 63.75 / 62.62 / 64.55s |
//!
//! Unchanged: the "after" range lies inside the "before" range on both corpora,
//! and the spread between two runs of the SAME build is larger than any gap
//! between the builds. It also has to be unchanged, which is why three runs are
//! enough to believe it: at the shipped settings
//! `min(now + 10 000 ms, now + 180 000 ms)` is the same instant the phase budget
//! alone produced, so the intersection is five `Option` comparisons per run and
//! not work. The difference shows up only when `classify_timeout_ms` is set
//! below five times `tableaux_test_timeout_ms`, which is when it is meant to.
//!
//! Do not quote a single pair from this table as "the" number. The two 30-second
//! rows are clock-bound and identical by construction; everything that can move
//! is in the other eight, which total under two seconds, so a 1-second gap
//! between two totals is the machine and not the code.
